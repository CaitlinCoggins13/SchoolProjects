To Compile:

Navigate to the folder Assignment and go inside it.

Run the line “javac -d bin src/*.java” to compile, HOWEVER the command prompt will not recognize the Test class and will throw errors on everything in it.  The only way to fix this is to move the SortedTest.java file out of the src folder.


To Run:

Compile first.

Run the line “java -cp bin SorterApplication” to run the program.
