To Compile:

Navigate to the folder Assignment and go inside it.

Run the line “javac -d bin src/*.java” to compile, HOWEVER the command prompt will not recognize the Test class and will throw errors on everything in it.  The only way to fix this is to move the DoublyLinkedListTest.java file out of the src folder.


To Run:

Compile first.

Run the line “java -cp bin RosterApplication” to run the program.
